There are a number of services (read: ports) that are firewalled because they're
not secure or under persistent threats from the outside. The university VPN
allows you to access these services.

There is a self-service portal via ITS at <https://luc.saasit.com/>.

We recommend that all students working on advanced projects to get access to the
VPN so they will run into few(er) surprises.
