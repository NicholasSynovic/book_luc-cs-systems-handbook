# IGnation and University Blogs/Wikis

The university provides a system called [IGnation](http://ignation.luc.edu/),
which supports wikis and blogs. While many of our users typically take advantage
of publicly available sources, e.g. Blogger and Wordpress, we would like to
encourage our users to consider these university-maintained sources as a
starting point.

Should these not be appropriate for your needs, we can establish a Google Site
for you via `google-apps-cs`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} for Your Domain (see
below), which is a feature-rich solution for maintaining public and private web
sites, and (unlike the university solution) can be used to collaborate with
those outside of the institution (as it is tied to e-mail addresses, not
university IDs).
