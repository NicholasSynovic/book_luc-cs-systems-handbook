{{% pageinfo %}} Note: As of June 30, 2010, we no longer provide desktop
computing support in the department. These needs are addressed by the ITS
desktop support group. This change does not prevent users from establishing
their own standalone desktop setup but we are focusing our efforts on
non-commodity needs that are synergistic with advanced teaching/research needs.

# Windows Desktop Support

Windows desktop matters are handled by ITS. If you are experiencing trouble with
Windows labs and other ITS issues, please open a support ticket at
<https://luc.saasit.com/>. Linux and Mac desktop matters are the responsibility
of individual faculty.
