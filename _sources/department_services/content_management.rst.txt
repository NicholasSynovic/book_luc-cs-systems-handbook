 Temporary Hosting using a VM
******************************

For students doing project work, we can provide temporary virtual
machines running on VMWare or Windows Hyper-V. These VMs can be
configured with a web server that is visible internally to Loyola. See
Virtualization for additional information.

 Alternatives
**************

We encourage those who need to set up web sites to consider establishing
web hosting account via one of the many providers out there.

Blogging platforms
==================

If you are just looking to maintain a simple site that allows for page
creation and blog posts, the best options are blogging platforms, such
as Wordpress, Ghost, Micro.Blog.

Linode
======

We actually use dedicated virtual machines for some department hosting
needs. A particularly nice option is Linode. For as little as $5-$10 a
month, you can get a dedicated virtual machine with any Linux
distribution you like.

This option is primarily for more technical users who know Unix/Linux
system administration (and commands).

Google Apps
===========

We do have Google Apps available in the department, which includes
Blogger and Google Sites. While both of these options are starting to
look/feel a bit dated, they nevertheless are easy to use and require
virtually no configuration (except for us to enable your site).
