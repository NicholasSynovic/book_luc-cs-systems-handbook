# 1. Use Sphinx

## Context

The current systemshandbook.cs.luc.edu website is a Docsy site powered by Hugo.
Hugo is notorious for breaking content between revisions, thus making maintence
difficult.

## Decision

To avoid this, we will progressively migrate the site to Sphinx.

## Consequences

Site content will be rewritten as ReStructuredText.
