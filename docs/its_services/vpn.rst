Getting started with the University VPN.

There are a number of services (read: ports) that are firewalled because
they’re not secure or under persistent threats from the outside. The
university VPN allows you to access these services.

There is a self-service portal via ITS at https://luc.saasit.com/.

We recommend that all students working on advanced projects to get
access to the VPN so they will run into few(er) surprises.
